# Object Colors for USD Composer

Color a whole USD stage by an object property, source file, or model. Edit colors in a legend and save the active scheme with the scene.

Each final Xform is one object. Coloring gives its whole subtree one solid color, including glass. Meshes and other child prims are not counted separately. Disable colors to restore the original materials and transparency.

Xforms containing lights or cameras are excluded so coloring cannot replace the sky or lighting materials.

This extension targets Kit 110.2 on Windows. See [supported data and limitations](docs/reference.md) and [verification results](docs/verification.md).

## Enable the extension

1. Put the `object.color` folder in an extension search directory.
2. Open **Developer > Extensions** in Composer.
3. Add the parent directory of `object.color` to the extension search paths if needed.
4. Search for **Object Colors** and enable it.

The panel opens automatically. Reopen it through **Window > Object Colors**.

## Color the scene

1. Open a USD scene.
2. Choose **Property**, **File**, or **Model** under **Color by**.
3. For Property mode, type beside the search icon to see matching properties as you type. Select a result to apply it.
4. Select **Enable colors**.
5. Click a legend swatch to choose another color.

Choose **No color** in the palette to reveal the underlying material for that group. Clear **Enable colors** to restore the whole scene.

Click **Refresh** after changing the scene or its properties. Existing assignments remain stable. Expand **notices** for objects that cannot be colored.

Use Composer's Undo and Redo commands for scheme and swatch changes. Save the scene to retain its scheme and enabled state.

## Run verification

Run the commands from the extension directory:

```powershell
./run-verify.ps1
./run-verify-kit.ps1
./run-verify.ps1 -Test tests/benchmark.py
```

The scripts use the Kit installation at `C:\kit-app-template\_build\windows-x86_64\release\kit`. Pass `-KitRoot` to select another installation. The Kit check starts a separate process and generates its own scene. Results and screenshots go to `verification/`.

For static typechecking, install `mypy` into `verification/typecheck` using Kit's Python, then run `./run-typecheck.ps1`.
